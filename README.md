# Musical Transcription of Drum Patterns Using Main Audio Features as Feature Vector in KNN
Authors: Charles Jayson L. Dadios and John Emmanuel I. Encinas

Abstract: Drums is a promient instrument in our musical culture. The most accurate way to learn how to play the drum parts of a song is by reading a drum musical chart. Learning and familiarizing to read drum notation can be an easy skill to pickup, but learning how to write charts takes more time and effort. This challenge encourages drummers to learn songs by ear, but people tend to forget the correct parts and play inconsistenly. Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT) can encourage drummers to read charts, and reading unlocks learning.
An algorighm was developed to transcribe drum recordings into two formats: MIDI and PDF. KNN was used to classify what particular instrument of the drums sounded off. The classifier used the drum's main audio features as a 77-dimensional feature vector. The algorithm yielded promising results to offer solution to the ADT problem.
